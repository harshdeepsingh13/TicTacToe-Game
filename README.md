# TicTacToe-Game
A game made out of Java, which we all played in our childhood! 
Game commonly known as "Zero Katta" or Zeros and crosses.

This is game which I tried to make is having dual playing modes, Single Player:in which you challenge the computer and 2 players: in which you play with you friend.
